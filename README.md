This assignment was to create a fictional event website using a Boothstrap.I created a website for a technology seminar. I used boothsrap to create the logo for the event and also for the nagvigation bar. Used boothstrap grids to create the background image the text. For the speakers section of the event I used grid cards to create them with a title and some information about the speakers in the card as well. Lastly I created a form using boothstrap for the users to register for the event. I customize some of the elements using CSS.
The website is easy to nagvigate through for the users, where they can simply slick on anything in the nav tab and it will take them to the desired section. My design choices were simple and kept within the theme of the website.
